# Snakes Challenge
Based on the [AI Crowd Snake Species Identification Challenge](https://aicrowd.com/challenges/snake-species-identification-challenge)

# Notes 
* No Longer doing tutorial from chapters
  * Won't be asked to do them
  * All the time we were doing tutorials in the first block we will now be doing the snake identification 
* We can use any method we like
* Stats/NN/CNN/etc
* Any combination of methods
* Get the dataset
* Apply techniques
* Understand what is and isn't working
* Explain what we did in the report
* Talk about what method we used
* The accuracy and more
* Some interesting metrics to use:
  * Precision
  * Recall 
    * There is a graph that can encapsulate these two fairly well
  * F1 score
  * Cohen's $\kappa$ (number between -1 and 1, that is somewhat similar to correlation), what accuracy we expect to get from chance
    * Anything above > 0.6 is doing well (humans normally get > 0.6)
    * Cohen's kappa takes the data's bias into account
  * Confusion Matrix
* Doesn't expect us to solve it explicitly
* Two people in a group, every group to submit their result to the competition
* Try different architectures
* Different hyperparameters
* Analyse results carefully
* Retraining
* Auto-encoders
* etc
* The more stuff we can try the more he will be impressed

Due the week before exams, **25th October 2019**. Innovation day is the 24th, research due on the 18th October 2019. 

By next week he expects us to have downloaded the dataset, show him that we can import the dataset into a project and that we have looked at the images and the different classes, different data, etc. We will get a mark based on it (either 1 or 0), that he may multiply by our final mark.
